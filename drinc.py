    This function generates the closure that defines the distributionally robust
    control design problem from "Distributionally Robust Infinite-horizon
    Control" (DRInC) by JS Brouillon et. al., 2023. The closure can be used
    afterward for various different optimization problems over the SLS closed
    loop map phi.

    :param sys: LinearSystem for which the constraints apply.
    :param t_fir: int > 0, length of the FIR SLS closed loop map filter.
    :param feasible_set: Polytope, the feasible set of the optimization problem.
    :param support: Polytope, the support of the noise distribution.
    :param radius: Radius of the Wasserstein ball
    :param p_level: Probability level of the cvar constraints
    :param radius_constraints: Radius of the Wasserstein ball for the
        constraints, if None, the same radius as for the cost is used.
    :param regular: float > 0, regularization parameter for the optimization
        (multiplies tr(Q)).
    :param verbose: bool, if True, prints the optimization verbose.

        closed loop map, xis are the samples of the empirical distribution at

        is the matrix square root of the weights W of the control cost
