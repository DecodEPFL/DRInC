    This function generates the closure that defines the distributionally robust
    infinite horizon quadratic cost $xi^T Q xi$, where xi is a realization
    of the noise, following a distribution with a given support.
    The closure can be used afterward for various different DRO problems over
    the cost matrix and for noise the distributions in a Wasserstein ball around
    various empirical centers.

    :@param radius: Radius of the Wasserstein ball.
    :@return: tuple of closures with signature (Q, xis) -> cost or cons, where
        Q is the cost matrix, xis are the samples of the empirical distribution
        at the center of the Wasserstein ball (one column per sample), cost the
        distributionally robust risk of the given Q and xis, and cons is a list
        of linear matrix inequality constraints.
